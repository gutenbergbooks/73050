</div>


<p>The pioneer battles on behalf of
Birth Control, as everybody knows,
have been fought in this country by
Dr Marie Stopes, who has largely borne
the brunt of that abuse which is meted
out to all popular exponents of ideas
that do not harmonize with traditional
morality. The fact that Dr Stopes has
been criticized, and at times attacked
by the medical profession (which until
recently refused to acknowledge that
the subject of Contraception fell within
its sphere) on the grounds that she
does not possess a medical degree, and
the fact that she has retaliated with
vigour—and continues to do so in most
of her public utterances, have led to a
breach between her and the more orthodox
elements of the profession, which
to a certain extent, has impeded the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
realization of her ultimate aim, namely
the undertaking by the State of the
work she performs on a small scale in
her privately-run clinique.</p>

<p>In what follows I have drawn attention
to drawbacks attending the dissemination
of knowledge of Contraception
by General Propaganda. I
have done so, however, fully realizing
that this propaganda was, in the first
instance, necessary to override the barrier
of prejudice presented by orthodox
morality, and equally realizing that if
it had not been for Dr Stopes and her
propaganda this book would probably
never have been written. In its essential
plea that advice on Contraception,
now obtainable only at private institutions,
be made generally available by
the Ministry of Health at the centres
under its control, this book is at one
with the wider aim expressed by Dr
Stopes in the words that commemorate
the founding of her first private clinique.</p>

<p>I know that in the past it has proved
nearly impossible in a single book to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
appeal effectively both to the general
public, and to the medical profession.
Yet I have attempted to do that here.
The task has been made perhaps less
difficult than usual by the fact that until
recently the subject of contraception
has been completely ignored by the
medical profession, which as a whole
seems to remain as uninformed of its
wider implication as does the general
public. It will be found that the book
ends with a practical suggestion taking
the form of an appeal to the medical
profession.</p>

<p>The substance of the first part of
what follows originally appeared as
a series of articles in The Saturday
Review, to which I am indebted for
permission to publish the book in its
present form.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="BIRTH">BIRTH CONTROL AND THE STATE<br>
<small>A PLEA AND A FORECAST</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Since the War, the subject of Birth
Control has been widely discussed, and
much has been written about it. By
some of its advocates it has been
extolled to the point where any criticism,
however tentative, is resentfully
repudiated. By its enemies it has been
represented as a pernicious and unnatural
practice leading to the degeneracy
and, ultimately, to the extinction
of the race. So wholeheartedly felt,
and yet so profoundly opposed are
these views, that it has been difficult
for the average person to find his
bearings on any other basis than that
of his own sentiment.</p>

<p>It is clear that the implications of
Birth Control, or, rather, what is generally,
though not logically understood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
by the term, of the practice of contraception,
are far reaching. It profoundly
affects the life of the individual; it
reacts upon the internal economy of
the community; and it has a most
important bearing upon the international
future of the country wherein
it is practised. It is therefore incumbent
upon all serious students of contemporary
world-problems to realize
clearly what is to be said on both sides,
and to form thereon, as far as lies in
their power, an unbiassed opinion.
This obligation weighs especially heavily
on medical men since, if the practice
is to be tolerated at all, it is by them
that it should be administered and
controlled.</p>

<p>It is a general survey of this sort
that is attempted here. The book will
begin with a consideration of the more
important arguments that have been
advanced on each side. These will
then be discussed, and there will follow
a conclusion as to the bearing of the
practice upon the future of civilization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span></p>

<p>It will be convenient first to review
the more serious arguments used
<em>against</em> Birth Control, the problem
being considered throughout both as
a world-problem and as one with a
special significance for this country.
They fall into two distinct categories
concerning (A) the Race and (B) the
Individual.</p>

<p>A. 1. The ‘military’ argument finds
exponents among Nationalists, who
are convinced that the essential merit
of a country lies in its powers of offence
and defence, or who are persuaded
that future wars are, by the constitution
of human nature, inevitable, and
that it is therefore necessary for the
country to which they belong to be
fully equipped. By such persons, Birth
Control is opposed in so far as it would
impair their country’s man power.</p>

<p>2. An argument allied to the above,
yet one which must be distinguished
carefully from it, deserves close scrutiny.
It is to the effect that quite apart from
military considerations the practice of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
Birth Control in a country is capable
of acquiring in a short time such
universality that the population may
decrease, and eventually dwindle to
proportions which would place that
country, whatever its status, in a
position of a second or third-rate
power. From history the approximate
generalization can be made that prolific
races get the better of infertile races
in the struggle, first for existence, and
then at a later stage, for power. This
generalization is likely to hold good in
an economic sphere. Thus a graphic
picture has been drawn of what will
happen to England, in the matter
of its population, if it follows in the
wake of France. It will come to
assume the proportions of an insignificant
little island in the North Sea,
the possessor, actually, of a mighty
past, but in the present counting for
nothing beside the densely peopled
territories of Southern and Eastern
Europe, Asia and America. Birth Control
uncontrolled means race suicide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span></p>

<p>3. There is an ‘economic’ argument
against Birth Control, which
itself takes two forms.</p>

<p>In the first place it is felt, in under-populated
countries like New Zealand,
Australia, and perhaps to a less extent
the United States, that since it is desirable
in the general interests that the
population should increase, it is to be
preferred that this increase be effected
from native-born stock rather than
through the process of accretion by
often undesirable aliens. Hence in
most under-populated countries, Birth
Control is opposed.</p>

<p>In the second place it is probably
felt (though probably not admitted)
by the Governments of those capitalistic
countries confronted with a labour
problem, which are at the same time
desirous of limiting immigration, that
the unrestricted multiplication of their
working classes, by causing a competition
for wages, will create a cheap
labour market. It is highly unlikely
that this view has much weight here,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
though it may easily be otherwise in
the United States, where the labour
problem is acute and where it is
universally desired to limit coloured
immigration and immigration from
South-Eastern Europe.</p>

<p>4. There is an argument against
Birth Control, which has special reference
to the position of this country as
the original founder of a great Empire.
Since most of the Dominions are still
under-populated and wish their numbers
to increase, and since the increase
of native stock, even though fully
encouraged, is unable to supply the
demand for labour, it is contended that
Great Britain should always be able to
turn out a numerical surplus to send to
the Dominions each year, which in
addition to satisfying a need for better-class
immigrants would serve to consolidate
the racial and cultural bonds
that keep the Empire together.</p>

<p>B. The above arguments concern
the race. The remainder which follow
refer primarily to the individual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span></p>

<p>5. A ‘medical’ argument has been
heard to the effect that the actual
practice of Birth Control or, more
precisely, the use of contraceptives,
is inimical to health, being capable of
causing both local disease and more
general constitutional disorders.
Emotional instability and various
neuroses have been quoted as such
products. No woman making use of
a contraceptive for the first time can
escape a feeling of revulsion at such a
callous interference with a process
that above all others should be spontaneous
and instinctive. No woman
can then fail to experience a sense of
aversion from such a deliberate
thwarting of Nature’s most fundamental
purpose.</p>

<p>6. Very potent also, is a ‘conventional’
objection which in practice
is often associated with the religious
argument next to be considered,
though in reality it is distinguishable
from it. On these grounds it
is felt that all that pertains to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
province of sex is indecent, disgusting,
and unfit for discussion. The topic of
Birth Control is thus stigmatized as
‘immoral’ by many people of no deep
religious conviction.</p>

<p>7. The ‘religious’ objection nowadays
finds its chief exponents among
the Japanese and Roman Catholics,
though it is also strongly upheld by
many Anglicans and others. By the
Japanese, Birth Control is condemned
on grounds that seem to be, partly at
any rate, nationalistic. The Japanese
religion, intimately connected as it is
with Ancestor Cult, holds that it is the
duty of every man to marry young, and
to produce the largest possible number
of children, especially males, who may
carry on the tradition of the family
and at the same time grow up into
soldiers capable of fighting for the
Mikado in war. By the Japanese, the
Mikado is believed to be a Deity incarnate,
not in the symbolical sense in
which some people have thought of the
divine right of kings, but in a real and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
vital sense, as ‘the occupant of a
sacred throne which was established
at the time when the heavens and
the earth became separated.’ To die
for him in war is the most supreme,
the most glorious duty. The objection
to Birth Control here would thus seem
closely allied to the ‘military’ objection
first advanced.</p>

<p>By Roman Catholics it is held to be
a mortal sin to employ any chemical
or mechanical means to prevent conception,
the only permissible form of
control being voluntary abstinence
from each other on the part of both
parents. The abstinence of one parent
against the will of the other is also
considered a mortal sin on the part
of the refractory parent. An exception
to this rule is now made which permits
parents not desiring children to make
use of a moment in the periodic life
of the mother during which conception
is less likely to take place than at
other times—the so-called ‘safe’
period. It is, however, generally agreed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
nowadays that the ‘safety’ pertaining
to this period is in many cases quite
illusory and devoid of serious physiological
or medical basis. Opponents
of the Roman Catholic Church have
represented its insistence on this prohibition
as dictated by a desire to
extend her spiritual empire throughout
the world, since obedience to it must
bring about a greater relative increase
of believing Roman Catholics than of
adherents to other religious denominations
tolerating Birth Control. But
its attitude would further appear to
express a conviction (manifested elsewhere
in the insistence upon celibacy
among Catholic priests and in its
systems of penances and abstinences)
that sexual indulgence is somehow
incompatible with devotion to a purely
spiritual life, and when excessive produces
a demoralizing effect upon human
nature, tending to make it weak,
lazy, selfish and often vicious. Probably
the Catholic Church feels that the use
of devices to prevent conception would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
abolish the necessity for salutary self-restraint,
and would promote promiscuous
and excessive indulgence. The
effect of this prohibition is that most
Catholics who are conscientious about
not using contraceptives have large
families. There are some, however,
particularly in France, who do not
take the prohibition very seriously.</p>

<p>At the bottom, however, of the
religious objection, would appear to
lie the conviction that excessive sexual
indulgence, dissociated from the sequel
of procreation and rendered possible
by the use of contraceptives, is morally
harmful to the individual.</p>

<p>8. An objection of a pseudo-political
nature is sometimes heard which
envisages a bureaucratic extension of
Birth Control. The phrase is here
understood to imply a ‘National Control
of Births’ and not a ‘Voluntary
Regulation of Births’, its more usual
acceptance. Such a bureaucratic interference
in people’s private lives is held
to constitute an infringement of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
liberty of the individual—in this case
his liberty to have as many children
as he likes, when he likes. The principle
of individual liberty, the corner-stone
of nineteenth century Liberalism, still
has a certain number of adherents.</p>

<p>9. The last outstanding argument
is to the effect that the popularization
of Birth Control will lead to a general
increase in promiscuity, both among
married and unmarried people. The
temptation to illicit indulgence would
be made greater, the process of seducing
an innocent girl would be made
easier, the ever-present lure of prostitution
to the underpaid girl worker
would be made more difficult to resist,
if an assurance could be felt that the
subsequent birth of a child—hitherto
a generally prevalent and effective deterrent—could
be prevented by the exercise
of a popularly known technique.
The restraint imposed by fear may
not be one of a high moral order, yet
the end which it serves is here, by
common consent, socially desirable.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
In face of the absence of any authoritative
source of information on Birth
Control, and of the indifference of the
medical profession with regard to it,
certain popular works on the subject
have acquired an immense vogue and
have enjoyed an enormous sale.
Though not intended for this purpose,
they are purchased and read extensively
by young persons in much the same
spirit that improper literature in general
is read. Further, the sale to adults of
these works containing as they do a
magnification and eulogy of the sexual
act <i lang="la">per se</i> (to be conceived, expressly,
apart from its normal biological sequel
of child-birth as a salutary and health-giving
process), and containing also
minute instructions as to the technical
use of contraceptives, has not been
confined to married persons. Such
works have been held to inflame and
pervert the imagination of the young,
and on pseudo-medical grounds, to
incite adults to promiscuity. It is to
be noted, however, that the above<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
is an argument directed not so much
against Birth Control itself as against
the method by which knowledge of it
is communicated to the public.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>These appear to be the most important
arguments currently advanced
against Birth Control.</p>

<p>It will be noted that several have
been omitted from consideration. The
one based upon biblical condemnation
is too futile to merit restatement. The
argument that contraception is ‘unnatural’
is equally undeserving of repetition.
The contention that it is anti-biological
will be discussed later.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Arguments on the other side will
now be considered. They divide themselves
into three groups, which may arbitrarily
be designated as International,
Social, and Individual arguments.</p>


<p class="p2">(<i>a</i>) <i>International.</i>—The connexion
between over-population and war is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
nowadays fairly obvious and is particularly
manifest in those countries which
are both industrially organized and
consciously nationalist in spirit. In the
absence of these two conditions over-multiplication
need not be followed by
war. India and China, for instance, are
very densely populated countries
where over-multiplication frequently
takes place. This process does not, however,
give rise to much danger of international
disturbance, in that both
countries are, from the nature of their
organization, incapable of conducting
war on modern lines, and neither has a
generally-felt, or a unifying national
consciousness. Excessive increase is
here frequently checked by famines,
which, though causing incalculable
suffering, do not readily generate wars.</p>

<p>Within recent years two countries
have demonstrated the relation between
over-population and war, or the
threat of war, namely Germany and
Japan.</p>

<p>In Germany before the war, where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
the ‘military’ objection to Birth Control,
first advanced, was prevalent,
there existed an ethical code by which
German mothers were persuaded that
they were fulfilling the highest spiritual
purpose of which their sex was capable
by producing male children destined to
be soldiers, prepared to fight for their
country in a victorious war. It is now
generally recognized here that it was
this attitude of mind, involving an expectation
and a glorification of war,
associated with the distinctively German
powers of efficient organization
centred in implicit obedience to the
Kaiser, which served to produce that
exultant pride of power and aggressive
national consciousness which precipitated,
if it did not actually cause, the
late war. The increase in the population
of Germany was advocated and
extolled without regard to that country’s
capacity to support her swelling
populations. To-day, though Birth
Control is largely practised by
the upper and middle classes in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
Germany as it is in this country, the
old ideal still lingers on, and to it is
attributable that fear of Germany
which, until recently, has so conspicuously
directed French policy since the
Armistice.</p>

<p>In Japan the connexion between
numerical increase and a possible war
is now coming to be recognized here.
Australia, New Zealand and the United
States are already definitely conscious
of it. The Japanese religion, based upon
piety towards ancestors (to whom
every man is bound to perpetuate his
family), and upon loyalty to the Mikado
who, as Emperor God, is held to
be divine, imposes upon all faithful
subjects the duty of marrying young
and of producing many children. This
injunction is again promulgated irrespective
of the native resources of
Japan, and in the past has necessitated
a considerable annual emigration to
other countries. The recent restrictions
imposed by America upon Japanese
immigration, themselves prompted by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
motives common to most English-speaking
races, have led directly and
inevitably to the existing tension between
America and Japan. As things
stand at present, it appears that this
tension is likely to increase and may
easily eventuate in a war, in which
there would be a greater probability
of our being involved than there was,
initially, of America being involved in
the late war. Both the Americans and
Japanese are sensitive and proud people.
After further tension has accumulated,
a trivial incident—the possible
murder of an American official in
Japan by some irresponsible person—might
lead to the despatch of a curtly-worded
note or to the formulation of
an abrupt ultimatum out of which a
second world war might, like the last,
suddenly flare up, to reduce modern
civilization to ruins and ashes.</p>

<p>Stress is laid on this particular aspect
of the population problem partly
because it is felt that few nations now
hold the desirable ideal of adapting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
their numbers to their particular economic
optimum, and partly because it
would seem that in face of this
nationally encouraged increase of population
and of certain apparently unalterable
race antipathies, <em>no amount</em>
of international pacifism, or of condemnation
of violence, or of genuine
humanitarian goodwill can prevent
war.</p>

<p>Germany and Japan display the connexion
between numerical increase and
wars most clearly to-day. It is possible
that in the future other nations
may become conspicuous in this respect.
Thus America, where the teaching of
contraception is illegal (in so far as
anything is), may, in another 50 or
100 years, develop an aggressive
foreign policy. And now that restrictions
have been imposed on the
entry of Italians into America, it
is conceivable that Italy may at
some time discover an Imperialist
mission on the shores of the
Mediterranean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>


<p class="p2">(<i>b</i>) <i>Social.</i>—This aspect of Birth
Control has been much discussed and
is concerned with the dimensions and
quality of the population of these
islands. The argument, in the form
in which it is usually advanced, distinguishes
a quantitative and a qualitative
point of view, the latter further
possessing two aspects.</p>

<p>Quantitatively, it has been pointed
out that in the last hundred years,
the increase in the population of this
country has been excessive. Because
England was the pioneer of the
Industrial Revolution, she enjoyed
initially an unprecedented national
prosperity, unharassed by competitors
and with the world as her market.
Though the conditions of many of the
early factory-workers were unquestionably
appalling, the wealth and economic
importance of this country increased
so rapidly that she was enabled
to support immensely greater numbers
than at any previous period of her
history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p>Thus in 1821 the population of England
and Wales was just over 12
millions; in 1921 it had risen to nearly
38 millions. That is to say that in a
hundred years our population had
more than trebled.</p>

<p>When, however, at the beginning of
this century other countries began to
enter into competition with us, and to
produce manufactured goods on a
large scale often underselling British
goods, our hitherto unchallenged industrial
supremacy gradually commenced
to suffer eclipse. But our
numbers have not adapted themselves
to our diminished power of employing
labour thus created. On the contrary,
the population has continued steadily
to increase, with the result that by
slow degrees the unemployment problem
which, at present, looms so large
on our political horizon began insidiously
to disclose itself. The
present formidable figure of nearly
a million and a quarter of unemployed,
together with a large number<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
of workers on short hours, testifies to
the fact that at the present time in
relation to existing economic conditions,
this country seems to be over-populated.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>From the point of view of quality
it has been pointed out that there are
two factors which now tend to impoverish
the race. They might be
distinguished and arbitrarily named
as ‘Dysgenic’ and ‘Economic’ respectively.</p>

<p>The dysgenic factor may be propounded
as follows: Though the
Birth-rate in England has fallen from
36 per 1000 in 1877 to 20 per 1000 or
less to-day, this decrease has not been
accompanied by a decrease in the population,
since the Death-rate has
dropped correspondingly. This has
taken place by reason of the complete
suspension, if not the actual reversal,
in civilized countries to-day of the
principle of Natural Selection, operative<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
amongst animals and primitive peoples.</p>

<p>There are three outstanding reasons
to which this suspension is attributable.
They are the advances in sanitation
and medical science, the increase in
humanitarianism, and the method of
obtaining votes which prevails in democratic
countries.</p>

<p>The advances in sanitation and
medical science made in the last 60
years have resulted in an enormous
reduction of infant mortality in large
towns, and also in an average prolongation
of life. Epidemics of smallpox,
cholera, typhus, diphtheria, scarlet
fever, etc., which took such a
heavy toll in the past, are now effectively
controlled by the existing system
of isolation hospitals, and of efficient
public health supervision. To-day
it is possible for the medical student
to traverse his six laborious years
of training without seeing a single
case of typhoid fever—a disease
which in the times of his elders used
to be one of the commonplaces of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
hospital. These improvements in
sanitation, the progress made in
aseptic surgery, in prophylactic medicine,
and in the general treatment of
disease, have been largely responsible
for the lowering of the death-rate already
mentioned.</p>

<p>The increase of humanitarianism in
civilized countries has resulted in the
creation of an enormous number of
philanthropic institutions and charity
organizations, through the channels of
which much relief is brought to the
impoverished classes. This spirit now
makes it difficult for those endowed
with a superfluity, or even a sufficiency
of wealth, to contemplate with indifference
the misery and degradation of
less fortunately placed fellow human
beings.</p>

<p>And lastly, since the entry to power of
any given political party is conditioned
by the acquisition by that party of a
sufficient number of votes, given by
a mainly proletarian electorate, it
follows that politics are likely to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
framed in such a way as to commend
themselves to such an electorate. It
would seem unfair to omit this fact
from consideration, though it has been
over-emphasized by a school of political
cynics who deny the participation of
humanitarian feelings in politics (outside
the realm of speech-making), and who
attribute to political expediency an
excessive if not an exclusive rôle in
improving the lot of the very poor.</p>

<p>In virtue, then, of these factors it
would nowadays be very difficult for
any individual, however worthless,
actually to starve, and many people of
defective stock and bad physique who,
in the ordinary course of nature would
perish, are now artificially kept alive
to perpetuate their kind.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The ‘economic’ factor tending to
produce deterioration in the race, presupposes
the dysgenic.</p>

<p>Among uncivilized peoples it is the
biologically superior type which is most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
prolific. In advanced civilized countries,
which are democratic in social organization,
the reverse obtains. Thus
among most primitive people, the
Chief—<i>i.e.</i> the man with most courage,
initiative, resourcefulness and power
of leadership—enjoys the possession
of most wives, and therefore produces
most offspring. The analogue of the
drunken unemployable of to-day would
probably not be permitted to marry.</p>

<p>In England now, however, the
drunken unemployable finds his nearest
approach to an occupation in
endowing his ill-fated wife with a
stream of children, the regular succession
of which is only eventually
interrupted by the breakdown, age, or
premature death of the wife, or by
the death of the husband. And the
only discouragement extended to such
a man is forthcoming from the strictures
passed upon him by his slum
neighbours. None is forthcoming from
the Government, and none from the
hospital, which gratuitously delivers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
the wife of her children. In fact, information
as to how she may arrest this
devastating succession of children is
deliberately withheld from her by
nearly all hospitals, because it is felt
that the condition of public opinion,
upon which the hospitals largely depend
for their finances, is averse from
her being enlightened in this respect.</p>

<p>The organization for relief in this
country is now so comprehensive and
far-reaching that every necessity can
be obtained gratis by those who cannot
afford to pay for it. Thus the wife
of the poor man is delivered of her
children free of charge; the children
are educated for nothing; if employment
is not available for them at the
time of leaving school, they are supplied
with doles and relief free of obligation.
And when they become senile,
they are given old age pensions gratuitously.
The funds necessary for the
administration of these works are
levied from the middle and upper
classes, in rates and taxes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>Now the Englishman possesses a
strong sentiment for institutions. A
man who has himself received a certain
kind of education, and who has
been brought up according to a certain
tradition, likes to provide the same
education and the same tradition for
his children. And if in the face of the
increase in taxation, the rise in the
cost of living, and the expenses of education,
he cannot afford this, sooner
than have children to whom he must
deny what he considers a good start
in life, he prefers to limit his family.
This obtains of the man who suffers
from a sense of obligation towards his
children. The opposite holds good of
the unemployed man at the other end
of the social scale. He feels that
he has sunk as low as is possible for
him while still remaining out of
prison. Insidiously his ambition and
his self-respect become sapped by the
soul-killing experience of finding himself
a useless parasite upon the community.
Frequently, as prison reports<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
show, he takes to crime or drink. And
slowly he is overcome by that sense of
irresponsibility, of bitterness, of carelessness
of the future, of improvident
fatalism that takes possession of those
living under continuously adverse circumstances.</p>

<p>It is a matter of indifference to him
how many children are born to him
since with each one his dole is increased.
None of the restraints which
enter into the longer view of the future
held by the middle classes is felt by
him. And so he goes ahead, and has
as many children as time and the health
of his wife (of which last he does not
always show excessive consideration)
will permit.</p>

<p>The following figures clearly illustrate
this state of things. Whereas the
number of children produced annually
by a thousand teachers is 95, by
Church of England ministers is 101,
by doctors is 103, the average number
produced by general labourers is 231.
And among these general labourers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
it is the least desirable individuals—those,
with least self-restraint, least
foresight and with least consideration
for their wives or the future of their
children—who have largest families.
And the undesirability may be of another
kind. Mental defectives generally
are very prolific. Girls of this
condition, if left unwatched, are constantly
becoming pregnant, there being
apparently no shortage of men prepared
to take advantage sexually of
such unfortunate victims. It is to be
noted that the economic situation following
war is especially favourable to
this discrepancy of fertility between
classes. It would seem that the recent
experience of the significance of war,
the existing sense of social instability,
the universal prevalence of unrest,
hatred and international discord, make
the more considerate parents feel that
the world is not a very desirable
place to bring children into. And
this feeling is emphasized if they
have to pay in taxation four times<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
what they had to pay before, after
which what money remains is worth
about sixty-five per cent. of its previous
value. But these considerations hardly
affect the classes whose occupation is
manual labour, or who have accustomed
themselves to no occupation at all.</p>

<p>Thus from a social point of view it
is to be observed that quantitatively,
in relation to the present resources of
the country, England is at the present
day considerably over-populated; and
qualitatively that many persons of all
classes possessing inferior physique are
now artificially kept alive to perpetuate
their stock, while at the same time
those elements of the population who,
by lack of intelligence or thrift or
steadiness, or who by possession of
other defects have been reduced to the
lowest level of the social structure,
to-day constitute the most fertile strain
in the country.</p>


<p class="p2">(<i>c</i>) <i>Individual.</i>—The argument has
frequently been heard that it is desirable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
to communicate knowledge of Birth
Control to the poorer classes in the
interests of the mother and the
children.</p>

<p>It is difficult to know what percentage
of the unwanted children born in
the poorer quarters of our large towns
are conceived as the result of a culpable
aggression on the part of the husband
upon his wife—as when he returns
home drunk on Saturday night and
threatens her with physical violence if
she refuses to submit to his conjugal
rights—or as the result of an ignorance
of Birth Control methods which are
familiar to the more educated classes.
Certain it is that a large percentage
of the children born are unwanted, and
equally certain that among the very
poor ignorance of contraception is
such as to appear incredible to those
who have not had personal experience
of it.</p>

<p>Thus in the Autumn of 1924 a
group of seven externs, working in the
district covered by Guy’s Hospital,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
made inquiries of the mothers whose
confinements they attended as to
whether the child just born had been
wanted or not. The inquiries were
made, when possible, on the tenth
day, when the patients were last
visited, in such a way that their answers
were more likely to be favourably influenced
by fondness for the child
than unfavourably by recollection of
the pains of labour. Furthermore,
where any doubt existed, as for instance
when a woman replied that she had not
particularly desired the baby before it
was born, but would not part with it
for the world now, she was given the
benefit of the doubt and the baby was
counted as wanted. In all, inquiries
were made in the case of seventy-eight
children born. Out of these, forty-seven
were definitely not wanted,
and thirty-one wanted; and the writer
can vouch for the fact that if these
figures erred at all, they did so on the
side of moderation. Thus, in at least
one poor quarter of London, well over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
half of the children born were emphatically
not wanted.</p>

<p>The hardships imposed on the
mother by such conditions are sometimes
very cruel. Numerous cases
have been quoted by advocates of
Birth Control in their propaganda
which there is not space to reproduce
here. The reader can, however, picture
to himself the experience of a
woman suffering from the sickness,
shortness of breath, emotional instability,
and deformity of pregnancy, having
to maintain life in some squalid slum,
house-keeping, cooking, cleaning and
tending the children without change of
air or scene and without holidays, up
till the incidence of the final labour
pains. And no sooner is a child born
than the husband reasserts his “rights,”
and the same dismal cycle repeats itself
without prospect or hope of change,
or of relief from a body that has
ceased to know the easy freedom and
self-forgetfulness of good health.</p>

<p>Indifference to the children appears.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
They are looked after out of a stern
sense of duty. The native impulse of
spontaneous maternal fondness is killed
by the deadly routine, and when, as
frequently happens, the child dies,
after a few pangs of grief, an easy
reconciliation (perhaps not without a
deep-seated sense of inward gratitude),
is made to what is acknowledged
as the “Will of the Almighty.” Sometimes,
the mother makes no secret of
her relief. But no man who has come
for any length of time in contact
with these working-class mothers
can fail to admire the patience,
the stoicism and the grim fortitude
with which they face their dreary
lot.</p>

<p>Their ignorance of Birth Control,
in face of the publicity the subject is
now given in the Press, is almost incredible.
The same quality of fatalism
and resignation felt by the soldier in
the war before the prospect of wounds
or death, is still evinced by these
women in the matter of child-birth.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
One frequently meets with a sentiment
that “we must take what comes
without grumbling,” that “what is
fated must be,” and even that “we
must not fly in the face of the
Almighty.” There further exists a
superstition that any object requiring
internal adjustment, like a pessary,
runs the risk of being lost in the
woman’s inside.</p>

<p>A further aspect of the problem is
the prevalence under the existing system
of the practice of abortion. It
is difficult, of course, to give any trustworthy
figures in this connexion, since
in many cases the fact that the mother
has attempted to induce an abortion
is not revealed to the medical man
who attends her, or to the hospital
authorities who take her in. The
methods usually resorted to are of an
amazing crudity. They vary from
the pregnant mother jumping three
or four times consecutively off a
table on to the floor or throwing
herself downstairs, to her swallowing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
large quantities of lead, ergot, quinine
and other substances as well as nocuous
doses of emetics, irritants and purgatives.</p>

<p>Frequently the woman practises
local violence upon herself, or engages
the services of a professional
abortionist, a class more numerous
than is generally supposed. Such a
person, after practising his art, is in
the habit of instructing the woman as
soon as she feels the pain or notices
any haemorrhage, to report herself
to a medical man or present herself
at a hospital where she is taken in as
an ordinary case of threatened abortion.
The responsibility for what may
subsequently happen to the woman is
thus effectively removed from the
abortionist’s shoulders, it being in
the interest of everyone concerned to
preserve silence as to the part he has
played.</p>

<p>The damage done to the health of
many poor women by such practices
is enormous, and might largely be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
avoided by a judicious instruction in
Birth Control.</p>

<p>When the effects of all this upon the
children are considered, it is at once
found that the question of Birth Control
is intimately connected with the
housing problem. The overcrowding
in large slum families is notorious. At
an early age the day is passed by these
children in the street, where, filthy and
untended, they receive little by way of
notice from their elders except hard
words or blows. Their nights are spent
packed, in a fetid atmosphere, several
together in the same bed from which
they may witness their parents in sexual
intercourse, sometimes their mother in
labour, and where they are free to
indulge in what, later in life, would be
called incestuous practices with one
another. The writer has on more than
one occasion attended a woman in
confinement while several children
were watching her from a bed in the
same room, there being, in the urgency
of the situation, no time to dispose of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
them and nowhere immediately available
to send them.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Substantially this is what has been
said on each side of this complex
question.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to discuss the
arguments heretofore propounded, it
is necessary to emphasize the fact that
from the technical point of view <em>a
really satisfactory contraceptive does
not yet exist</em>.</p>

<p>The chief disadvantage attaching to
the contraceptive used by the man is
that it is quite impossible to induce the
type of individual whose procreation
we would wish to restrict to use any
contraceptive at all.</p>

<p>The child is usually begotten by such
a parent when he is drunk, and everyone
who has had experience of the
conditions prevailing in bad slums will
know that it is futile to expect to
achieve anything along these lines
through the man. The problem must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
be met through the woman who, unlike
the man, has to put up with the discomfort
and the pain of repeated pregnancies,
and has to shoulder the main
burden of large families. Were it not
for this elementary human fact all
attempts to teach Birth Control to the
very poor and destitute would fail
completely.</p>

<p>Essentially, contraceptives which the
woman can use are of two sorts, and
involve two principles—namely, a
mechanical or occlusive, and a chemical
or spermicidal principle.</p>

<p>The objections to the first are two,
namely that they are far from being
fool-proof, and that unless sanctioned
by a doctor their use can be followed by
serious harm. It will be clear to any
medical man that for a patient suffering
from gonorrhœal cervicitis, or indeed
from any condition involving a chronic
cervical discharge, the use of an
occlusive pessary may lead to disastrous
consequences. The broadcasting of
promiscuous advice as to the utilization<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
of these objects in the absence of an
examination by a competent medical
man or woman is therefore to be
strongly condemned.</p>

<p>The drawback, to all existing spermicidal
suppositories is simply their uncertainty,
though they are as nearly
fool-proof as anything of the kind can
be. It is possible that by further research
a suppository, physically harmless
but of certain action may be discovered,
in which case, from its practical
and sociological aspect, the problem of
birth control will be greatly simplified.
It remains, however, a little doubtful
whether the chemical principle, however
actively spermicidal, will ever
dispense with the necessity of some
occlusive device. But this is a sphere in
which later research may prove of great
value, and nothing but a tentative statement
is now possible. The statement
may, however, be made that if there is
one method of Birth Control as to
whose harmfulness there is little room
for doubt, it is the method of coitus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
interruptus. In both sexes it gives rise
to a condition of chronic anxiety
which, nowadays, is far from uncommon.
In the absence of local disease
any of the above methods of contraception
is preferable to this one.</p>

<p>The effectiveness of those women’s
contraceptives now in vogue is difficult
to estimate. There is little doubt that
an unduly high estimation of their
success has been formed in certain
quarters, based on the assumption that
in cases of failure, the working woman
will promptly report the event to the
centre where the contraceptive was
obtained. The writer is persuaded that
this is often a mistaken assumption,
and that many cases of failure pass in
consequence unnoted. There is also
difficulty in knowing whether the
instructions in the adjustment of the
occlusive pessary have been adequately
followed out. This process is not
always easy, and as has been said
above, is far from fool-proof.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>The arguments above advanced will
now be considered in their relation to
(<i>a</i>) the Individual and (<i>b</i>) the Race.</p>


<p class="p2">(<i>a</i>) <i>The Individual.</i>—The arguments
relating to the individual are
divisible into those applicable to (1)
married, and (2) unmarried persons.</p>

<p>(1) It is to be noted that some of
the contentions advanced on each side
apply to the different phases of the
married life of the woman.</p>

<p>Thus the revulsion of feeling against
the use of contraceptives is experienced
chiefly by the woman who has had
either no children or few children. On
the other hand, the woman who has
the greatest need for a knowledge of
Birth Control is the one who has had
many children and desiring no more
would probably feel little or no aversion
from taking precautions against
conceiving them. It appears to the
writer that there is no adequate
objection to communicating to such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
a multiparous mother this much
needed information.</p>

<p>The difficulty in the case of the
newly-married woman is of another
type. The discrepancy between the
ages at which human beings reach
sexual maturity and at which they find
themselves capable of maintaining a
family, raises a number of exceedingly
difficult problems. Seeing that the
sexual requirements of man constitute
a factor varying very greatly from
individual to individual, and to a
large extent depending, as is now
realized, upon a very complex balance
of glandular functions, it is more
difficult than most popular moralists
seem to realize to lay down general
rules applicable impartially to every
body.</p>

<p>Questions such as the following are
raised: Can it reasonably be expected
of <em>every</em> man to live ten or more
years of his sexually adult life in
complete continence? If not, is it
better for him to marry young and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
probably unequipped to support children,
having remained continent till
that time, or to marry later, probably
better equipped financially to become
a father, yet having had promiscuous
experience of women before marriage?
And if he does marry young, can he
be expected to remain continent in his
married life till he and his wife feel
that they can satisfactorily maintain a
family? If he finds he cannot do this,
should he proceed to have children
whom he cannot properly support, or
is it better for the couple to overcome
their dislike of contraceptives—a
feeling which it is idle for advocates of
Birth Control to ignore—and thus
avoid having children till they are
wanted? These are a few of the general
questions which are raised in this
connexion to which no comprehensive
answer can possibly be given.</p>

<p>Much controversy has revolved
round the question of the desirability
of self-control as a means of regulating
births, and of its universal practicability.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
It is here contended that
where possible this is immeasurably
the best means of regulating births. At
the same time, it is futile to advance
a counsel of such perfection and difficulty
that a highly probable failure to
observe it will be followed by socially
disastrous results. Everyone would
acknowledge that the Medical Officer
of a military unit who refused to instruct
the soldiers under his supervision
in the precautions they should take
against contracting venereal disease, on
the high moral grounds that they
should never expose themselves to such
risk, would be carrying his idealism to
socially harmful lengths. Yet it is a
much more difficult task for two people
in love with each other and living
together in the intimacies of married
life to exercise continuous self-denial
over long periods extending to years,
than it is for the soldier to abstain
from occasional promiscuity. In both
cases it is clear that the correct
course is to start by putting the case<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
for restraint as clearly and forcibly as
possible, and then to explain what
steps must be taken in the event of
that restraint proving too great a
task. In the Army and Navy such
appeals, when tactfully made, have
met with a response which justifies the
view that, within limits, more can be
done in this way than might be supposed.
As a general rule, then, it would
appear desirable that contraceptives
should be used as little as possible, especially
in the early years of married life.</p>

<p>It also seems to the writer that in
the case of normal married people,
too much has been made of the demoralizing
effect of the ‘excessiveness’ of
that indulgence which is supposed to
be permitted by the practice of contraception
and which forms the basis
of the ‘moral’ objection advanced in
this country. This argument frequently
emanates from ecclesiastical sources,
where knowledge of the sexual aspect
of human nature as well as of the
technical side of contraception is apt to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
be restricted and biassed. In effect, the
man who is sufficiently provident and
considerate of his wife to encourage
the necessary precautions (which—a
point too often ignored by prejudiced
critics—from the immediately selfish
point of view both parties would far
sooner forego), is not the kind of man
to indulge in reprehensible excesses.
Actually, demoralization seems rather
to be produced in those men who insist
on gratifying themselves regardless of
their means, or of the welfare of the
children they so abundantly procreate,
or of the feelings and health of their
wives.</p>

<p>(2) The case of unmarried persons
clearly falls into a different category.
There can be little doubt that the
publicity given to the subject of Birth
Control has kindled the imagination
of many young people and led to various
transgressions. The requirement
here is to discover a method by
which at the same time this publicity
may be diminished and information<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
made selectively more available. Both
these results could be achieved if the
subject were taken up by the Ministry
of Health, and facilities created for
the appropriate giving of knowledge
thereon by responsible qualified persons.
By such means the particular
advice suited to each individual case
could be privately given, precisely
where it is required, and steps might
be taken to stop the journalistic broadcasting
of information and discussion
which has brought the subject into such
discredit.</p>

<p>The effects of this measure would be
comparable to the arrest of the literature
upon the subject of venereal
diseases, and to the reduction of their
incidence that has been brought about
by the institution of special departments
for the treatment of these
diseases in the large towns.</p>

<p>It is clear, however, that all arguments
relating to the individual are
limited in their appeal to those in
whose minds the conception of morality<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
is somehow related to that of individual
harmony and happiness and to the
ideal of the general good. To those for
whom the word ‘morality’ has an ulterior
meaning, unconnected with the
affairs of this world and relevant,
solely, to the destiny of the individual
soul—I refer, here to those who enlist
the ‘Will of God’ of which they are the
self-constituted interpreters, on their
side—no argument can be of any avail.
Since the subject is thus removed from
the sphere of practical controversy, no
further discussion is possible, and the
only thing to hope is that with the
passage of time such persons will
become less numerous.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Consideration of the arguments
bearing upon the individual, it is submitted,
points to the desirability of
(1) the Ministry of Health giving the
subject recognition and sanction, and
(2) limiting the publicity that now
attaches to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>


<p class="p2">(<i>b</i>) <i>The Race.</i> Turning now from
the individual to the race, we enter on
a more difficult part of the subject.
Adhering to our original conception of
the question we find that the solution
(if it is to be accepted as such) of the
quantitative difficulty, and of the qualitative
problem described as ‘economic’
in nature, are one and the same. The
remedy for that aspect of the qualitative
problem distinguished as ‘dysgenic’
is different and must be considered
separately.</p>

<p>The quantitative difficulty reduces
itself to this. Admitting the greater
fertility to-day of those whose occupations
are manual, or who have no
occupation at all (in other words, of
the less select type) and admitting that
<em>at the present moment</em> the country is
overpopulated, how are we to be certain
that we are not within sight of
more prosperous times when unemployment
will disappear? And how are
we to feel assured that the dissemination
of knowledge of Birth Control<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
will not, in the long run, lead to a
disastrous decline in the birth rate,
producing an irretrievable diminution
in our numbers?</p>

<p>The practical difficulty is here to
prophesy what will be the optimum
population (i.e., that at which average
return of labour per individual would
be greatest) for a given country fourteen
years ahead—at the time, that is,
when the children born to-day would
enter the labour market. And here we
are in the realm of almost pure guesswork,
and probably no economist could
be found who would venture upon
more than a tentative speculation.
What the optimum is at the moment remains
even a disputed question. There
is reason to suppose that unemployment
returns are not necessarily a
trustworthy guide to the figure. A
consensus of opinion however exists
(including that of Mr. Baldwin) that
<em>at the moment</em> our numbers are above
their optimum, though expectations
vary almost infinitely as to what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
the optimum will be in a few years.
Those who hope for a boom in trade
are satisfied with the present condition.
Others who do not anticipate such an
event, would more willingly see an
alteration brought about. In the
absence of any definite knowledge, the
best we can do is not to try to look too
far ahead but to consider the solution
of our problems as we find them to-day.
<em>At the moment</em> the indisputable facts
of the problem in this country are that
we are over-populated, that contraception
is practised too much by the upper
and middle classes—perhaps even by
the skilled working classes—and not
enough by the improvident unskilled
masses at the bottom of the social
edifice.</p>

<p>The outstanding question is whether,
as a result of a reduction of our numbers
to a point somewhere in the neighbourhood
of the economic optimum for
this country—by which reduction the
existing burden of taxation, an increasing
element of which is now devoted to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
charity and relief, will be correspondingly
diminished—our upper and middle
classes would be enabled to produce
more children, and to continue to produce
enough to maintain our numbers
in the neighbourhood of their optimum.</p>

<p>The answer to this question depends
on a further question. To what extent
is the relative sterility of the professional
and skilled working classes attributable
to the heavy taxation now
imposed on them, and to the rise in the
cost of living due to the war, and to
what extent is it the result of a preference
shown by many people for a more
or less luxurious life, with few or no
children, to a simpler life with several
children? In other words, to what
extent is it attributable to an economic
factor and to what extent to motives
of selfishness?</p>

<p>To what extent does that quality
of self-interest play a part which
prompts a woman to refuse to breastfeed
her baby because she is afraid of
the effects thereof upon her figure,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
which causes her to abstain from having
children because she dislikes the
discomfort and deformity preliminary
to, and the actual pains of, childbirth,
or which makes her value amusements
and expensive forms of pleasure and
recreation more highly than the experience
of maternity? To what extent is
the relative infertility of the upper and
middle classes accounted for by the
kind of egotism which induces the
husband to go in for entertaining, for
a motor, and a house with several
servants, and generally to live in comparative
affluence rather than do
without his superfluities and bring up a
family of children? This attitude
nowadays certainly plays a part. Dissatisfaction
with the elementary pleasures
of life, the craving after artificial
stimuli and new sensations, have always
been, and probably will always remain,
the surest way to decadence in a race,
and as such should be combated. It is
more in the interest of the race that the
professional and artisan classes should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
produce plenty of good children than
that the families of the very poor
should be restricted. The argument
is sometimes advanced by complacent
and wealthy individuals that the working
classes should be encouraged to
reproduce freely in order to keep up
the country’s numbers. The dirty work
is thrown, so to speak, on the shoulders
of those least qualified to discharge it.
It must appeal to the sense of justice
of everyone that if the maintenance of
numbers of the race is to be conceived
as a burden (which of course it should
not), the burden should be borne
equally by all classes.</p>

<p>The writer, who has had occasion to
witness the results of over-multiplication
among the very poor, feels that it
is only in fairness to them that they
should be equipped with every possible
means of improving their lot. At
present one of the most important of
such means is the creation of facilities
by the Ministry of Health for the
giving of information to those mothers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
who need it about how they may limit
their families and space their children.
The immediate social results of such
a measure would unquestionably be
good. The remote results are more
open to doubt. And it is this doubt
which renders it of the utmost importance
to add that every form of
pressure and persuasion be brought to
bear on the other classes, to make them
realize that it is morally incumbent on
them, in the interests of the country
and of the race, to have as many children
as they can possibly afford, even
at the expense of the minor luxuries
of life.</p>

<p>Up till now no such pressure has
been exerted, and most people regard
it as a matter of moral indifference,
whether, when married, they have
children or not. The problem as to
whether the general public, once it
has been educated to realize the
national importance of the question of
having children, would act upon it
and thereby avert the threat of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
dwindling population is again one of
great difficulty. Admittedly, the example
set us by France is not encouraging.
What is the likelihood of our
following in her footsteps? It is a
delicate and important question. The
writer is of the opinion that our
national character differs from that of
the French in a way that would make
us more responsive to such an appeal
for children than the French have
shown themselves to be. But again
we are in the realm of conjecture, and
each person is entitled to his opinion.</p>

<p>The fact remains, however, that as
long as the advertisement now given
to Birth Control is permitted to continue,
its practice will become yearly
more prevalent. Its spread will certainly
not be limited by an attitude of
official negativism towards it while the
propaganda is allowed to continue
unchecked.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>There remains the other process
above distinguished as ‘dysgenic,’ the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
effect of which upon the quality of
the race is probably as detrimental as
the one just considered, namely, the
nurture and perpetuation of the
morally and physically unfit. This
tendency can only possibly be met by
some form of Eugenic legislation. The
existing opposition to anything of the
sort in this country probably springs
from a deep-seated dislike of bureaucratic
interference in people’s private
lives, and is associated with a failure
to realize the harmful consequences of
the existing order. It is of interest,
however, to observe that in America,
where, in practice if not in theory,
individual liberty is valued less highly
than in this country, various enactments
have been passed with a definitely
Eugenic object. Thus in the
State of Nebraska marriage is forbidden
to anyone afflicted with venereal
disease, and all applications for marriage
licenses have to be accompanied
by affidavits of freedom from such
disease. Nobody acquainted with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
the nature of the infant mortality
produced by congenital syphilis can fail
to approve of this measure.</p>

<p>In 1895 the State of Connecticut forbade
the marriage of epileptics and
feeble-minded persons, under penalty
of three years’ imprisonment. Everyone
possessing knowledge of the Neurological
Out-patients’ Department of
any large hospital must realize the existing
prevalence of epilepsy and appreciate
how this hereditary disease may
incapacitate and stultify its victims.
Montana provides for the sterilizing
of idiots, epileptics, feeble-minded and
insane persons, which measure must
again commend itself to those aware of
how prolific such types can be if left unwatched.
In males, sterilization can be
effected by a very minor operation, the
use of X-rays for this purpose being
a procedure with regard to which there
is still medical controversy.</p>

<p>The principle might even be extended
to individuals who, by a record
of crime or misdemeanour, prove themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
to belong to a type which the
nation does not want perpetuated.
The sterilization of the male leaves
quite undisturbed his sexual function,
though it destroys his power of
reproduction. The infringement which
it therefore involves of the liberty
of the individual is far less than
that made by the State when it
takes it upon itself to hang a man.
Yet the social benefit arising from the
two measures cannot be compared.
Though it is difficult at this stage to
define the details of Eugenic legislation
it seems likely that the physical and
moral standard of the race could
broadly be raised by such a qualitative
Birth Control.</p>

<p>The number of emigrants which we
are in a position to send to the
Dominions each year is limited by
difficulties of transport, and could
never amount to more than a fraction
of our present unemployment figure.
There is further the important consideration
that the Dominions themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
do not relish the idea of our regarding
them as dumping grounds for our
superfluous undesirables. The type
of emigrant they want is a courageous,
hardworking, physically healthy type,
capable of initiative, of withstanding
hardships without grumbling, and of
making a good citizen. Such do not
tend to become unemployed here,
though, under very adverse circumstances,
they often may. A decrease
of our population need not therefore
be opposed to our Imperial interests
if, in the process, we raise the standard
of the race and improve our national
stock.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>What will be the bearings of such
enlightened Birth Control upon the
future? It will affect the Individual
directly in his immediate relation to
his family, and it will influence him
indirectly through its effect upon
the community as well as through the
international relationships of the
country to which he belongs. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
international implications will be considered
first, since they are the most
far-reaching.</p>

<p>The most obvious of these is the
connexion between unrestricted increase
of population and wars. To
what extent was the late war due to
this cause, and to what extent has the
world learnt from it the necessity of
regulating such increase?</p>

<p>The causes of the late war were
complex and are not yet wholly understood.
A fact however stands out
clearly now that we contemplate it in
retrospect and now that changes in
international feelings have forced upon
us a consideration of the point of view
of our late enemies. It is that the
causes now recognized are essentially
different from what those causes were
represented to be in the war propaganda
of the various belligerents.</p>

<p>It is to the interests of each belligerent
to place the whole blame for
a war upon its enemies and completely
to exculpate itself. Thus in the late<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
war both sides were convinced that
they were fighting for Righteousness,
Liberty, Justice, Law and Order, Civilization,
etc., against enemies inspired
by cruelty, subtlety, insatiable greed,
jealousy and lust for world-power.
When, however, we contemplate the
war after a lapse of several years
through an aftermath of much suffering
and disillusionment, we realize
that it was the product of historical
causes and racial antipathies and of
certain social and economic phenomena
rather than of any unequal partition of
moral qualities.</p>

<p>Before the war, Great Britain was
the most powerful nation in the world
and was naturally jealous of any other
nation that coveted, or aspired to
usurp, her enviable status.</p>

<p>Russia found herself in a condition
of acute social instability, momentarily
threatened by the event which in 1917
cast her beyond the pale of western
civilization. To Russia the war came as
a happening which could dissipate the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
revolutionary ferments, mobilize her
refractory workers into the army, and,
through the tremendous appeal of a
national crusade, sidetrack the forces
of anarchy in precisely the way that
those forces were sidetracked in Ireland
in 1914. Had the war been won
quickly—as there were grounds for
hoping when it began—the Czar would
probably still be on the throne of an
enlarged and yet more powerful Russia.</p>

<p>By the events of the last hundred
years Germany had been elevated from
a position of relative unimportance to
that of the most highly organized and
perfectly industrialized power in the
world. In achieving this promotion
she had earned the venomous hatred,
born of her humiliation, of France, and
the slowly growing, disquieting suspicion
of Great Britain.</p>

<p>Conscious of her growing industrial
strength, becoming restive within the
frontiers which confined her swelling
population, aware of the hostility of
her neighbours, and never allowed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
forget that her kingdom had been built
upon the sword, the youthful soul of
Germany found, in her Emperor, a fitting
symbol for her aspirations. He was
the creation of her mood, and together
with the party of which he was the
mouthpiece led her to her downfall.</p>

<p>It would not be a fair statement to
assert that population pressure in Germany
was the cause of the war. It
was unquestionably a part-cause and a
predisposing cause, as it was of migration
in prehistoric times and of most
wars since. But it was here complicated
by other factors both inside and
outside Germany.</p>

<p>The universal desire to avert a similar
catastrophe in the future has materialized
in the League of Nations.
It is hoped that through its agency
many precipitating causes of war will
be eliminated. By it provocation will
be made more difficult and commitment
more perilous. But the essential
predisposing cause, that of over-multiplication,
remains unassailed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
Like some dull-witted monster it is
left to wax in strength and malignancy
within its fetters, till at last, no longer
to be denied, it will break all bounds,
turn, and rend the world. From the
late war no lesson as to the importance
of population control has been learnt.
Will another war be necessary to teach
us this lesson?</p>

<p>Earlier in the book reference was
made to the possibility of a war between
Japan and either America or
ourselves. Though this contingency is
being thought out in detail by the naval
authorities of all three countries, care
is taken in diplomatic circles to assert
that such practical measures as the
equipment of Singapore imply no unfriendly
or suspicious attitude toward
Japan. Few people, however, are deceived
by these utterances. The mutual
fear and distrust is growing and will
probably continue to grow. There is
little doubt, that, if this war comes
about, its essential cause, the increase
of Japanese in excess of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
power of maintenance of their country,
will be obscured by that outburst of
vilification of the enemy and glorification
of self which is now demanded
by popular sentiment in the conduct
of wars. Yet this cause will remain
here incomparably the most important
of the predisposing causes. After such
a war will there remain any vestige of
civilization to profit from the hard-won
lesson?</p>

<p>The principal aim of Soviet Russia
to-day is the spread of her communistic
principles throughout the world. The
chief obstacles to this are the firmly
entrenched and powerful capitalism of
the United States, and the more
diffused and essentially more vulnerable
capitalistic organisations of the
British Empire. These last the Russians
are doing their best to undermine now.
A second world war would give them a
long-coveted opportunity. Realizing
that prolonged wars and the social unrest
that follows them are the soil from which
revolutions most readily spring, Russia<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
would probably associate herself with
Japan. The secret treaty between the
two countries whose aspirations and
political ideals have otherwise little in
common, gives a premonition of this.
By the time a war comes it is possible
that the exploitation of China by
Japan will be more complete, and the
effects of anti-foreign propaganda, carried
on by Russia, more far-reaching.
The increase of anti-British feeling in
India, also stimulated by Russia, will
co-operate to unify Asia and European
Russia in a solid block, determined to
shake off the yoke of the Western
Powers and of America.</p>

<p>Such a war could never be conclusive,
however prolonged. The vast length of
the fighting front, the colossal numbers
of active belligerents, and the enhanced
destructiveness of war would probably
lead, after initial successes, to a collapse
of the organized fighting forces
of the West. The seeds of revolution
in Europe, by then more deeply
sown, would germinate, and the present<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
social order would come to an end.
The continent would then embark upon
a new phase of its history, with the
first chapter steeped in the bloodshed
of revolution, and founded upon the
ruins of our industrial civilization. The
centre of civilization might then shift
to the southern hemisphere where to-day
there is less to destroy.</p>

<p>The fact remains that if the price
that humanity will have to pay for
learning to regulate its over-multiplication
is to be a second world war—the
much talked of war, this time,
between East and West—it is doubtful
if there will be left a civilization capable
of learning the lesson. It seems
worth while, therefore, to try to put
the principle into effect before we are
taught its necessity in such a way. To
this there are at present two obstacles,
namely the nature of certain religions
and the criterion of national evaluation
that is still prevalent.</p>

<p>The first obstacle rests in the fact
that two powerful religions have not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
adapted themselves to the changes of
human relationships imposed by the
unification through science of the human
race. These religions remain with
their eyes fixed either on the next
world or on the exclusive welfare of
the tribe.</p>

<p>By the Catholic Church a mode of behaviour
is imposed calculated to achieve
salvation in the next world irrespective
of its effects on this one. Omitting from
consideration, as probably unjust, the
motive of wishing to increase the number
of its adherents, with which the Roman
Catholic Church has been charged by
reason of its attitude towards Birth
Control, there remains a motive arising
from a theory of a relation between
salvation in the next world and certain
modes of behaviour in this. Contraception
is condemned because it is held to
incur damnation. It is not condemned
because it leads to social injustice,
to wars, to human suffering. The
point is that it is still condemned in
spite of its leading away from these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
things. It is therefore devoutly to be
hoped that in the event of the population
of any Catholic country at any
time in the future expanding to proportions
that threaten the peace of the
world, the Pope will see his way to
modify the Church’s attitude in the
matter before it is too late. Failure to
do so would result in the depressing
spectacle of the leader of the religion
of ‘Peace and Goodwill’ among men
deliberately refusing to take a step to
avert war.</p>

<p>The second type of religion is represented
in Japan and is tribal in the
sense that it is avowedly concerned
with the glorification of the Japanese,
irrespective of the consequences to the
world that this may involve. In its
object of elevating Japan to the status
of a first class power the cult of revived
Shinto has succeeded admirably and
has proved itself, in several wars, to be
a splendid fighting creed. The present
increase of the population of Japan
by 700,000 a year is wholly in accordance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
with its precepts. Again we may
devoutly hope that it will not overreach
itself and plunge Japan, as well
as the rest of us, into a world war
after which we would probably cease to
exist as civilized countries. It is, of
course, obvious that a modification of
Japanese policy where Birth Control is
concerned would be welcomed with inexpressible
relief by the rest of the
world.</p>

<p>The militancy of Mohammedanism
will probably have little effect on the
future of the world, because Mohammedan
countries are at present poorly
organized for extensive modern war.
The Church of England is more concerned
with the social and international
implications of religion than any other,
and the above remarks have little
relevance to it.</p>

<p>If, therefore, the cataclysm above
contemplated is to be averted the
first necessity would seem to be a
revision of the standards of existing
religions, in consideration of the unification<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
of the human race, so as to accord
with a formula of something of
this sort: That is good and morally
right which will promote the general
happiness and goodwill of humanity,
and the harmony of the world. It is
clear that action leading to the limitation
of over-multiplication would in
this sense be good and in accordance
with religion.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The second obstacle to the realization
of a control of population is the
standard by which the merit of a nation
is now generally appraised, and to
which most nations aspire. This merit
is largely estimated in terms of power
of offence and defence. This is a bad
criterion and should be altered for a
better one which will now be considered.</p>

<p>Earlier in the book reference was
made to a biological argument against
contraception, consideration of which
was deferred. This argument holds that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
in so far as reproduction is a primary
biological function, a thwarting of that
function is not only unnatural but anti-biological.
This view has a certain
plausibility but does not stand close
scrutiny. The criterion of biological
value or fitness is essentially racial,
not individual. That is biologically
good which will improve or benefit the
race, that is bad which will harm or
weaken it.</p>

<p>Under stable conditions of racial
equilibrium there is a reasonable expectation
that instincts and structures
which have had survival value in the
past will continue to have such value
in the future. But during moments
of crisis, at those turning points in
the history of living things when new
forms appear, such a presumption is
quite unjustified. Thus if we picture
to ourselves, allegorically, an event
which probably took many thousands
of years to accomplish, we might
imagine the comments of a conservative<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
piscine critic upon the emergence
of the first Dipnoid from some muddy
river on to land.</p>

<p>The development of fore and hind
limbs from fins, of lung from swim-bladder,
and of instincts appropriate
to the new medium, would strike all
conservative fishes as highly immoral
deviations from that biological tradition
which had given stability to the
glorious race of fishes. Nothing could
seem more a-biological. Similarly with
the development of fur and feathers
and of the parental instinct, all of
which were probably, in part at any
rate, invested with survival value by
the spell of cold which followed the
Secondary period, and which perhaps
conditioned the substitution of birds
and mammals for the hitherto ubiquitous
reptile as dominant vertebrates on
the earth. From the point of view of
the conservative reptile such changes
would appear highly anti-biological.
In moments of racial crisis, therefore,
it is dangerous to generalize as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
to what is biologically good from
past experience alone. In the
past a high degree of fertility has been,
for most species, a biologically valuable
asset. It does not follow that it
will continue to be so for the human
race. In fact there are good reasons
for supposing that it will not.</p>

<p>The human race is now passing
through a biological crisis unprecedented
in the history of life. It has
achieved a mastery over nature such
that mankind is now economically
unified throughout the world by the
astounding feats of intercommunication
and transport. But as yet the
human race has achieved little ethical
unification. It is directly in the
interests of the race that such unification
should take place, and all things
which promote it may therefore be
considered biologically good. And of
those things a restriction of human
fertility is one of the most important.</p>

<p>What then is to be our biological
criterion of racial fitness and our standard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
for judging of a nation’s merit?</p>

<p>It is clear that our biological criterion
must be racial rather than individual.
Division of labour and differentiation
of function are carried to such lengths
in civilized societies that it does not
seem possible to hold up any individual
type as an ideal of biological fitness.
Qualities which, to the solitary animal,
would irrevocably spell extinction may
for the gregarious animal have the
highest survival value. Thus no attribute
would be more irremediably fatal
to a non-social animal than sterility.
Yet the sterility of 999 out of 1000
female bees in the community of the
hive has endowed the species with a
vitality and a biological importance
such that it has largely conditioned the
appearance on the planet of many
kinds of entomophilous flowers. Our
biological criterion must therefore,
with our standard of merit, be social
rather than individual, and the following
general outline is suggested.</p>

<p>The population of each country<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
should be proportionate to its resources.
The numerical adjustment should be
such that there be no unemployment
and that individual productivity be
highest without idlers at either end of
the social scale. The physical average
of the race should be good with no
congenital diseases of mind or body
and with the minimum of other diseases,
and of crime. There should be a
high average standard of comfort,
self-respect and happiness, and a high
moral standard of honesty, tolerance,
and kindliness. One would hope for
a wide prevalence of that ‘joie de vivre’
and contentment which is doubtless
largely temperamental in origin and
which contributes more to an individual’s
happiness than any number of
worldly possessions can ever do. And
the social cleavage between classes,
and the now stupendous discrepancies
between the very rich and the very
poor should be reduced to a minimum.
Such conditions all would wish generally
distributed. It is a question<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
whether a uniformly high degree of
intelligence should be equally ubiquitous.
In every community, primitive
or civilized, an immense amount of
crude physical labour has to be done.
The soil has to be tilled, someone has
to dig coal and iron out of the ground,
and endless other kinds of manual
work have to be performed. It is
doubtful whether the possession of a
very high degree of intelligence would
make such workers happier or more
efficient. But whatever we may individually
feel about this point, we
would all wish such workers to be
healthy, happy, well housed, contented
with their lot, fond of their children,
and both appreciated by, and on good
terms with, the rest of the community.</p>

<p>And obviously it is a condition of
this sort which an enlightened Birth
Control could help to achieve.</p>

<p>The above is intended both to be a
criterion of biological fitness for the
human race, and a more satisfactory
standard of national evaluation than the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
one that is in vogue to-day. It will be
noted that there is nothing in it about
capacity for wars. If we could substitute
some such standard in place of the
armament standard by which to grade
countries in an order of merit, we
should be in a better position to avert
the catastrophe of another world war
than we are at present. According to
such a standard the country most deserving
of admiration, respect and imitation
to-day would probably be
Switzerland. Knowing that she cannot
defend herself against her powerful
neighbours, she does not aspire to large
armies. When other countries can, by a
simultaneous control of population, realize
a similar security, it will be open
to them to follow in her footsteps. The
ideal may not appeal to the romantic,
but much that passes for romance is frequently
pernicious nonsense, like the
sentiment by which war is glorified in
the eyes of many women and elderly
men who have never participated
in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<p>From an international equilibrium
based upon a modification of religions
as above suggested and upon an alteration
in our standards of national evaluation,
social harmony would follow
fairly readily. It is unlikely that the
antagonism between capital and labour
will be much affected by a control of
population beyond removing that
source of social unrest which is furnished
by a large body of unemployed.
It remains doubtful, however, if the
essential political issue will be much
modified by a solution of the unemployment
problem. The psychological
forces which give the Labour party its
driving power are not such as to produce
the fullest economic prosperity in
this country; but none the less they demand
and must ultimately receive satisfaction.
The best that can be hoped
is that those forces will gradually be
appeased, and will not lead to bloodshed,
too great a dislocation of trade,
or too drastic a loss of international
status.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p>The gain to the individual following
the general application of knowledge
of Birth Control will be twofold. In
the first place parents will be able to
space their children in accordance with
their physical and financial resources;
in the second they will feel more confident
of producing healthy well-balanced
children, untainted by disease,
than they can feel at present. Their
children would further be welcomed by
the community, and their future would
be assured.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Such are the bearings of an enlightened
Birth Control upon the future. It
is obvious that such advantages could
only be gained by slow and laborious
degrees. The writer is far from the
opinion that the application of his
views will immediately transform the
world into a Utopia. He is convinced
however that if the existing form of
civilization is to have any permanence,
the necessity for controlling population<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
will have to be realized and striven
for by all educated people.</p>

<p>In practice, the ‘plea,’ referred to
in the sub-title, is that the Ministry of
Health should give the subject of contraception
its sanction. In May of
1924 a petition supported by twenty-two
Labour members of Parliament
was presented to the Minister of
Health by a deputation of eighteen persons,
some of them well known, requesting
that official permission be accorded
to doctors in charge of Welfare
Centres to give information on Birth
Control to such working women as desired
it and were considered fit for it.
Though the existing technique is not
wholly satisfactory it is avowedly
worth something, having already
proved of great help to many women.</p>

<p>This permission was refused in deference,
it seems, to ecclesiastical opinion,
to certain reactionary political forces
which, in the House, were opposed to
it, and to popular prejudice. It is
possible that by the time this book is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
published the Ministry of Health may
have changed its attitude. At present,
however, information on contraception
can only be obtained from a few
private organizations such as those of
the Malthusian League in Walworth
and Kensington, of Dr Stopes in Holloway,
and from another centre in the
Edgware Road. The Malthusian
League has worked quietly, unostentatiously,
and, so far as its means allow,
with the utmost effectiveness in one
of the poorest quarters of London.
For what it has done there can be
nothing but praise.</p>

<p>But however valuable the work of
these organizations, they cannot possibly
meet the requirements of our
large slums, where such information
as exists is handed about by irresponsible
midwives and gamps, often with
the worst results. It also seems desirable
to the writer to restrict the often vulgar
publicity by which this subject is
frequently attended, and to which
attention was drawn when the objections<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
to Birth Control were reviewed.
After the first blast of criticism which
it would evoke from the baser organs
of the press, such a sanction from the
Ministry of Health would render further
newspaper advertisement of
Birth Control superfluous. If it does
not cease of its own accord steps
should be taken to suppress it. How
best can this sanction be obtained?</p>

<p>Clearly through an appeal from the
medical profession. An expression of
unanimity, or relative unanimity, from
doctors in this country as to the
desirability of this sanction would constitute
an argument which the Ministry
of Health could not easily ignore. If
the sanction were thus obtained it would
be open to those medical men who had
approved the measure in this country
to invite their colleagues in other
countries to follow in our footsteps. It
would seem best to begin with Germany
and America, where there is reason
to suppose that such an appeal would
meet with response. If support were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
forthcoming from these countries, others
might be approached—such as Japan,
Italy and perhaps India, in which last
the suffering caused by an excessive
birth rate and a high early death rate
is immense and almost wholly avoidable.</p>

<p>In this way the medical profession
in whose hands the health of each
community lies would take the first
step in the direction of an international
control of population, and would
thereby lay the basis for a genuine and
permanent world-peace.</p>
